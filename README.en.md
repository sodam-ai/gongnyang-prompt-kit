![Gongnyang Prompt Kit VOL.2 key visual](docs/main.png)

It takes a request as loose as "make me a poster" and returns a complete, ready-to-generate Korean production prompt. The rules were hardened while producing a ~1,000-image library of editorial spreads, posters, and comics — all distilled into a single skill. The key visual above was itself generated from a prompt this kit compiled (C11 cinematic key art).

> Interactive demo: **[kimsh-1.github.io/gongnyang-prompt-kit](https://kimsh-1.github.io/gongnyang-prompt-kit)**

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kimsh-1/gongnyang-prompt-kit
ln -s "$PWD/gongnyang-prompt-kit/skills/image-prompt" ~/.claude/skills/image-prompt
```

In Claude Code, run it with triggers like "write an image prompt", "editorial spread prompt", "key art", or `/image-prompt`.

- Install with a symlink and repo updates apply automatically. If you copy it instead, re-copy on every update.
- The validator requires Node.js.

## What it does

![Compile demo — loose request → complete prompt → validator pass](docs/hero.gif)

Loose request → complete prompt → validator pass. All three steps happen inside the skill.

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| "make me a spring-night night-market poster" | A complete prompt specifying scene, camera, lighting, palette (HEX), and text placement + `AR 4:5` |

Image generation itself is out of scope. For bulk generation and parallel spawning, use the `codex-imagegen` skill in [codex-fleet](https://github.com/kimsh-1/codex-fleet); for a single image, feed the prompt straight to `codex`. (Generating requires a [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) login + ChatGPT Plus/Pro.)

## Before / After — same request, same model

The **only** difference is the prompt. Left is a human's one-liner fed as-is; right is that same one-liner after the kit compiles it — same gpt-image-2. The kit outputs **Korean** production prompts (its target is Korean-first rendering), so the compiled prompt below is shown in Korean, exactly as generated. The full set of compiled prompts lives in [`examples/showcase.jsonl`](examples/showcase.jsonl).

## Presentation decks & complex diagrams (C6·C12) — 40-cut gallery

Not just posters and spreads — **presentation slides and complex conceptual diagrams** compile through this kit too. The "gpt-image-2 can't draw diagrams" assumption is disproven across 40 cuts — sequence diagrams, many-to-many networks, feedback loops, and even **400–800 characters of ultra-dense rendered Korean per slide**.

| Ultra-dense text (Transformer, ~700 chars) | Cache-strategy comparison table (~700 chars) |
|---|---|
| ![Transformer ultra-dense slide](examples/diagram-gallery/dense-16x9/DN-TRANSFORMER-001.png) | ![Distributed cache comparison](examples/diagram-gallery/dense-16x9/DN-CACHE-008.png) |
| **TCP sequence diagram (lifelines, crossing messages)** | **21:9 data slide (ticks, value labels)** |
| ![TCP 3-way handshake sequence](examples/diagram-gallery/complex-16x9/CX-TCP-002.png) | ![Quarterly growth report data slide](examples/diagram-gallery/deck-21x9/D12-DATA-007.png) |

**Full 40-cut gallery → [`examples/diagram-gallery/`](examples/diagram-gallery/)** (infographic · 21:9 deck · complex concept map · ultra-dense text, 10 each + source prompt jsonl).

Three levers that unlock diagrams:

- **The primary lever for text accuracy is canvas height.** 21:9 (codex path ~810px tall) shrinks glyphs at 400 chars. Secure height with 16:9 (~950px) or 2:3 and 700–800 chars stay crisp. The codex path normalizes large canvas requests to a ~1900px long edge, so accuracy is won through aspect-ratio choice.
- **The free-write zone is the key density weapon.** Pin only the critical labels in quotes and delegate body copy to `genuine Korean sentences, fully written in real hangul`; the model fills in conceptually correct explanations on its own (logically consistent down to B-tree key distribution and Raft log indices).
- **Sequences, many-to-many, and feedback all go through the front door.** The bottleneck isn't model capability — it's how concretely you specify nodes, links, and direction in sentences.

> 💡 Ultra-dense text slides are most stable at tall aspect ratios (16:9 · 2:3). Pin critical copy like titles and key figures in quotes, delegate body density to the free-write zone, and re-roll only the cuts you need.

## Promo graphics (P1–P8) — designer poster grammar

A layer that renders in the tone of **real designer-made promotional material**, not the card-news look of an informational SNS card. Eight layout grammars (P1–P8) distilled from 14 designer references — structures where type is not decoration but physically entangled with the subject, plus a 2–3 color hard-lock and print-finish devices (barcode, crop marks, edition number). Orthogonal to the look presets (L) and cross-breedable with them. Details in [`skills/image-prompt/references/promo-router.md`](skills/image-prompt/references/promo-router.md) (per-pattern drop-ins in [`references/promo/`](skills/image-prompt/references/promo/)).

### Base patterns (P1–P8)

| P1 Type-mask · photo inside the letters | P2 Type-environment · isometric terrain | P3 Oversize crop + occlusion |
|---|---|---|
| ![P1 type-mask — seoul](docs/showcase/PR01.webp) | ![P2 type-environment — RUN isometric](docs/showcase/PR02.webp) | ![P3 occlusion — BREW](docs/showcase/PR03.webp) |
| **P5 Meta UI · selection box** | **P6 Street collage** | **P8 Monochrome staging** |
| ![P5 meta UI — FORME selection box](docs/showcase/PR04.webp) | ![P6 street collage — street pop](docs/showcase/PR05.webp) | ![P8 monochrome staging — silver](docs/showcase/PR06.webp) |

### Cross-breeds · Korean base

Patterns cross-bred 2–3 at a time and anchored with a Korean headline.

| Occlusion × shadow narrative (C11) · "집" | Masking × type-environment · "폭풍" | Light shaft × staging · "고요" |
|---|---|---|
| ![집 — a 3D single glyph's shadow becomes a night skyline](docs/showcase/PR07.webp) | ![폭풍 — storm clouds inside the letters, lightning through the gaps](docs/showcase/PR08.webp) | ![고요 — an amber light shaft falls through the letters onto whiskey](docs/showcase/PR09.webp) |
| **Masking × selection · "소리"** | **Rotation axis × masking · "바다"** | **Letters = bookshelf · "책방"** |
| ![소리 — halftone crowd, one glyph in color selection](docs/showcase/PR10.webp) | ![바다 — vertical masking + 90° rotated photo](docs/showcase/PR11.webp) | ![책방 — two glyphs are actual bookshelf furniture](docs/showcase/PR12.webp) |

Korean headlines stay safe at **2 characters for both masking and extrusion** (3+ tends to smear the strokes); occlusion holds together with a single `reads behind it` sentence.

## Hongdae indie mood line (L9) — the Hongdae-byeong gallery

A Hongdae indie mood line (look preset L9) that decomposes the "looks-cool" feeling into **8 generation engines** rather than gut feel. Typography that opens a word into a world (A), art-movement reinterpretation (B), collage (C), film photography (D), Riso zine poster (E), mixed media (F), still life (G), and **shadow narrative (H)** — where an object's cast shadow bleeds into a cinematic scene. The same mood, drawn eight ways. Shadow narrative connects directly to the skill's `shadow_narrative` (C11) grammar.

| H · Shadow narrative (film camera) | A · Word-world (dawn) | D · Film (night) |
|---|---|---|
| ![shadow narrative — film camera](docs/showcase/HD01.webp) | ![word-world — dawn](docs/showcase/HD02.webp) | ![film — night](docs/showcase/HD03.webp) |
| **B · Movement (psychedelic)** | **E · Riso zine (poster)** | **C · Collage (Memphis)** |
| ![movement — psychedelic](docs/showcase/HD04.webp) | ![Riso zine — poster](docs/showcase/HD05.webp) | ![collage — Memphis](docs/showcase/HD06.webp) |
| **G · Still life (wabi-sabi)** | **F · Mixed media (face montage)** | **D · Film (pojangmacha)** |
| ![still life — wabi-sabi](docs/showcase/HD07.webp) | ![mixed media — face montage](docs/showcase/HD08.webp) | ![film — pojangmacha](docs/showcase/HD09.webp) |
| **H · Shadow narrative (whiskey glass)** | **A · Word-world (summer night)** | **D · Film (basement club)** |
| ![shadow narrative — whiskey glass](docs/showcase/HD10.webp) | ![word-world — summer night](docs/showcase/HD11.webp) | ![film — basement club](docs/showcase/HD12.webp) |

Korean copy renders cleanly across every cut — shadow narrative (H) nails even a 3-word Korean slogan in cinematic key art where the story opens from object to shadow. Look-preset drop-ins are in [`skills/image-prompt/references/look-presets.md`](skills/image-prompt/references/look-presets.md).

## Core rules

Not rules for making it come out well, but rules that **block the habits that make it come out badly**.

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| **No negatives by default** | gpt-image-2 renders scene negatives like "no crowd" using that very word. Express all scene exclusions positively — "one person in frame, alone". |
| **Only two whitelisted exceptions** | Tier-1 text-render guards (`no duplicate text`, etc. — 7 of them, only when there is rendered text) · Tier-2 editorial-compliance pair (only when explicitly declared). Every other negation gets caught by the validator. |
| **No leading brackets** | Size is an API parameter. The prompt carries only a single trailing `AR x:y` token. |
| **Text placement is a zone grammar** | "top-third title band", role labels (headline/subhead/callout), pinned quoted copy. Dense text pairs with quality high. |
| **Gear specs → result description** | The model doesn't know `Canon R5 f/1.4`. Write the result: "shallow DoF, background falls off softly". |
| **No SD quality tags or dead words** | `masterpiece, 8k` is noise, and so is "make it pretty / luxe / award-winning". If the standard lives outside the prompt, you only get the average — reduce it to numbers, bodily responses, concrete examples. |
| **Pin numbers** | HEX palettes, Kelvin, `key:fill 1:2` — numbers raise quality. |
| **1 line = 1 cut = 1 call** | Don't grid multiple cuts onto one canvas. (Exception: when the grid itself is the deliverable, like card-news.) |

## Two formats

| | Format A — 6 labeled sections | Format B — editorial flat-comma |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | Scene / Camera / Lighting / Color grading / Texture / Text-in-image | subject→face→hair→genre anchor→scene→wardrobe→composition→lighting→palette `#HEX`→texture, chained into one comma sentence |
| **Use** | Posters, key art, infographics, atlases — structural work in general | solo-figure editorial spreads only |

## Categories C1–C12

Fashion/editorial · beauty · Korean poster · product atlas · campaign · infographic · card-news · branding mockup · 3D icon · comic/webtoon · cinematic key art · **presentation deck (new)**. Cut types and default AR are in `references/category-patterns.md`.

"Make it look premium" isn't assembled by feel — pick from the **9 look presets** in `references/look-presets.md` (luxury editorial · cinematic grade · minimal product · Swiss typography · dark tech · retro print · pastel · gold foil · Hongdae indie) and drop them in.

To fan out multiple concepts or start from a concept, use the **variable axes** in `references/concept-axes.md` — 10 aesthetic movements (Bauhaus to wabi-sabi, decomposed into formal-language drop-ins), bodily-response translation ("make it luxe" → "makes you lower your voice and watch quietly"), contradiction-pair layer separation, music/scene→color translation, and 4 typographic-art techniques (the T1·T3 pairs in the [before/after](#before--after--same-request-same-model) above are the real thing). Sweep the same subject across one axis and you get mass-producible concept variants.

## Validator

Checks automatically whether a written prompt kept the rules. It is tier-aware and catches only negatives outside the whitelist.

```bash
node skills/image-prompt/scripts/check_prompt.mjs examples/poster.txt      # text mode
node skills/image-prompt/scripts/check_prompt.mjs --tier 2 examples/hwabo_formatB.txt
node skills/image-prompt/scripts/check_prompt.mjs --jsonl examples/prompts.sample.jsonl
node skills/image-prompt/scripts/check_prompt.mjs --test                   # regression self-test
```

Returns `{ok, format, tier, errors, warnings}` JSON. Negatives outside the whitelist, leading brackets, SD dead-vocabulary, size-lock violations, and residual slot tokens are `error` (with a positive-rewrite hint); empty adjectives, missing HEX, etc. are `warning`. Passing and failing samples are in `examples/`.

## Structure

![Kit structure — loose request → skill core → references → complete prompt → validator → image generation](docs/architecture.png)

A loose request passes through the skill core and references to become a complete prompt, and must clear the validator before generation. (This diagram was also generated from a C6 infographic prompt compiled by this kit.)
